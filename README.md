# EWC-python
A python implementation of elastic weight consolidation introduced in [Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00796).
## Prerequisites
* pure python implementation, no need for any machine learning framework.
* write with python 3.6, but can run with python 2.7 after simple modification.
## Running
run main.py to get start.
## Result
accuracy of the network after each task
